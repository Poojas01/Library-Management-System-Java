# Library-Management-System-Java
I developed a **Library Management System** using **Java and MySQL** to manage books, users, and transactions efficiently. I implemented **JDBC** for database connectivity, allowing seamless interaction between Java and MySQL. **Java Swing** was used to create a user-friendly GUI for managing book records, issuing books, and tracking returns. **Multithreading** ensured smooth concurrent access, while **prepared statements** enhanced security by preventing SQL injection. Additionally, I integrated **role-based access control** and search functionality to improve usability. This project strengthened my expertise in **database management, GUI design, and OOP principles**, delivering a scalable and reliable library system. ðŸš€
